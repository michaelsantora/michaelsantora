<h1 align = "center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Michael</h1>
<p>I'm Michael from New Jersey and I am currently in school pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I work full time at a Fortune 25 tech company as the Sr. Manager of Business Intelligence supporting Base Marketing Programs for our Global Enterprise and Public Sector customers. I am mainly responsible for analytics and identifying KPIs to drive our teams business strategy. I am familiar with Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MERN Applications (MongoDB, Express, node, REACT). I'm interested in data science along with econometrics and plan to get my Masters in Computer Science. </p>
<br>
<p>I am happily married since 2019, and have 2 boys (a 2 year old and new born that was born on Thanksgiving this year). I enjoy reading, playing music (guitar / piano), drinking lots of coffee, building watches, building models of historic WWII battleships, and going on walks with my wife! I have a pitbull mix that thinks he is cat and a tabby cat that thinks she is a dog. Although we haven't traveled in a while because my life is extra crazy these days, if I could go somewhere it would be Italy or Greece. </p>
